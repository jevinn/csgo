# CS:GO Match Outcome Prediction

This project aims to predict the outcome of CS:GO matches using machine learning and deep learning techniques. The dataset used for training and evaluation is obtained from OpenML.

## Files Included
- `dataset.txt`: Raw dataset obtained from OpenML.
- `df.csv`: Processed dataset after preprocessing and feature selection.
- `csgo_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation code.

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`, etc.).
3. Run the `csgo_prediction.ipynb` notebook to reproduce the results.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning techniques in predicting CS:GO match outcomes based on in-game statistics. The Random Forest Classifier performs the best among the models considered, achieving an accuracy of approximately 82.57% on the test set.
